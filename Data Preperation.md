Apend query will append two or more tables.

### Merge & Group the columns
If we are combing 2 tables and their data type is not same, then it will create two columns in the new table.

### Dates & Hierarchies
The date datatype of the column helps to drill down the date, month, quater, year.

### Line Chart
These line charfts are very useful. In the legend section, if we choose more fields the values will be based on that only.
