# Power BI concepts
The major building blocks of Power BI are: datasets, reports, and dashboards. They are all organized into workspaces, and they are created on capacities.

## Datasets
A dataset is a collection of data that you import or connect to. Power BI lets you connect to and import all sorts of datasets and bring all of it together in one place. Datasets can also source data from dataflows.

## Shared Datasets
Business intelligence is a collaborative activity. It's important to establish standardized datasets that can be the 'one source of truth.' Discovering and reusing those standardized datasets is key. When expert data modelers in your organization create and share optimized datasets, report creators can start with those datasets to build accurate reports. Your organization can have consistent data for making decisions, and a healthy data culture. To consume these shared datasets just choose Power BI datasets when creating your Power BI report.

## Reports
A Power BI report is one or more pages of visualizations such as line charts, maps, and treemaps. Visualizations are also called visuals. You can create reports from scratch within Power BI, import them with dashboards that colleagues share with you, or Power BI can create them when you connect to datasets from Excel, Power BI Desktop, databases, and SaaS applications. For example, when you connect to an Excel workbook that contains Power View sheets, Power BI creates a report based on those sheets. And when you connect to a SaaS application, Power BI imports a pre-built report.

## Data modeling and visualizations
Power BI Desktop is a free application you install on your local computer that lets you connect to, transform, and visualize your data. With Power BI Desktop, you can connect to multiple different sources of data, and combine them (often called modeling) into a data model. This data model lets you build visuals, and collections of visuals you can share as reports, with other people inside your organization. Most users who work on business intelligence projects use Power BI Desktop to create reports, and then use the Power BI service to share their reports with others. When you launch Power BI Desktop, the Getting Started dialog box will appear, which provides useful links to forums, blogs, and introductory videos.

In Power BI Desktop, you will begin to build reports in the Report view. You will be working in five main areas:

1. Ribbon - Displays common tasks that are associated with reports and visualizations.

2. Report view, or canvas - Where visualizations are created and arranged.

The Data view allows you to view all of your data available in your report. This is an easy way to quickly check data types and validate data.

The Model view allows you to visually set the relationship between tables or elements. A relationship is where two or more tables are linked together because they contain related data. This enables users to run queries for related data across multiple tables.

3. Pages tab - Located along the bottom of the page, this area is where you would select or add a report page.

4. Visualizations pane - Where you can change visualizations, customize colors or axes, apply filters, drag fields, and more.

5. Fields pane - Where query elements and filters can be dragged onto the Report view or dragged to the Filters area of the Visualizations pane.


## To Visualize and Analyze a data by transfoeming the data with the help of data model.
Data can be visualizated and analyzed through the PowerBI desktop. We can view dashboards, reports, and Power BI apps
## PowerBI Desktop -> Transform, Model, Visualize, Analyze
## PowerBI Cloud -> Share & collaborate
