# Power BI concepts
The major building blocks of Power BI are: datasets, reports, and dashboards. They are all organized into workspaces, and they are created on capacities.

## Datasets
A dataset is a collection of data that you import or connect to. Power BI lets you connect to and import all sorts of datasets and bring all of it together in one place. Datasets can also source data from dataflows.

## Shared Datasets
Business intelligence is a collaborative activity. It's important to establish standardized datasets that can be the 'one source of truth.' Discovering and reusing those standardized datasets is key. When expert data modelers in your organization create and share optimized datasets, report creators can start with those datasets to build accurate reports. Your organization can have consistent data for making decisions, and a healthy data culture. To consume these shared datasets just choose Power BI datasets when creating your Power BI report.

## Reports
A Power BI report is one or more pages of visualizations such as line charts, maps, and treemaps. Visualizations are also called visuals. You can create reports from scratch within Power BI, import them with dashboards that colleagues share with you, or Power BI can create them when you connect to datasets from Excel, Power BI Desktop, databases, and SaaS applications. For example, when you connect to an Excel workbook that contains Power View sheets, Power BI creates a report based on those sheets. And when you connect to a SaaS application, Power BI imports a pre-built report.

## To Visualize and Analyze a data by transfoeming the data with the help of data model.
Data can be visualizated and analyzed through the PowerBI desktop. We can view dashboards, reports, and Power BI apps
## PowerBI Desktop -> Transform, Model, Visualize, Analyze
## PowerBI Cloud -> Share & collaborate
