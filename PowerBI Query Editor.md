There will be raw sales data. We have to clean the messy data and combine the data to get the report.

Our goal:
1. Sales categories
2. Promotions
3. Sales over time
4. delivery time

We need to Transform the data, create data model and visualize the data. Open the sales csv file and open the transform data. This will open a query editor for us to do the data cleaning.
