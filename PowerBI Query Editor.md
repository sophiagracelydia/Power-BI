### 1) To remove the top 2 rows which is empty/blank rows in the data.
##### Home-> Remove rows-> Remove Top Rows
After removing the top 2 rows it will show in the applied steps to the right - This helps to keep track the changes made in the data). Also we can reconfigure the steps to make changes without removing the applied steps.

There will be raw sales data. We have to clean the messy data and combine the data to get the report.

Our goal:
1. Sales categories
2. Promotions
3. Sales over time
4. delivery time

We need to Transform the data, create data model and visualize the data. Open the sales csv file and open the transform data. This will open a query editor for us to do the data cleaning.
